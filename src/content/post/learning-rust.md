I thought that I'd take a shot at learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Now, here's the plan: I'm starting small. I've decided to rewrite one of my current projects in Rust. How hard can it be...?

### Why Rust? 
The promise of performance gains and a whole new way of thinking has lured me into its tangled web. I'm either about to hit the jackpot or stumble into a rusty mess. Let's find out.

From triumphs to facepalm moments, when the dust settles, who knows what the outcome will be? Maybe I'll emerge as a Rust virtuoso, or perhaps I'll end up with a tangled mess of code that rivals a rusty old bicycle. But at least I'll have fun along the way, right?
