Currently one and a half weeks into my four-week vacation.
It's the first time in a long while that I haven't had to make an effort to avoid thinking about work, and it's quite nice, actually.

The past few days have been a mix of rain and sunshine, and while I prefer the overcast skies to blazing sun (I'm not a summer person...), it wouldn't hurt to have a bit more of that summer-y weather.
