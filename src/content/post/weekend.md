Had a fairly productive week that included a two-day workshop where we managed to consolidate our various backlogs into just 3. Perhaps not ideal but an improvement nevertheless.

I also took the time to revisit some of my old projects and tools, performing some long-overdue code cleanup and small optimizations.

Tomorrow I am going to buy some new plants for my apartment I think.
