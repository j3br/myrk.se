Tomorrow's the big day â€“ I'm starting a new job.

The nerves are real, and all those worries I used to save for "future me" have now inevitably become present-me problems.

Imposter Syndrome? Turbo mode.

Overthinking? You bet.

Deep down, I recognize that Imposter Syndrome is a notorious liar. It has a way of casting doubt on our skills and achievements, even when we've earned our place. So, for my first day, I'm acknowledging its presence but trying not to let it dictate my actions.

On the plus side, new beginnings offer a unique chance to redefine who we are. I hope to learn new things and meet new and interesting people.
